                                My name is Jason and I'm a CS student that graduated with a Computer Science degree.
                                I created this website for educational purposes.
                                <br><br>
                                One of the things I enjoy about programming is the rush of excitement when you finally
                                solve a bug or problem with code.
                                <br><br>
                                Another passion of mine is gaming. Some of the games I play are Apex Legends, Puzzle &
                                Dragons, and MapleStory. The mushroom you see to the right is from Maplestory!
                                <br><br>
                                One unique thing about me is that I studied 5 languages, and can currently speak 3 of
                                them. The 5 languages I studied are English, Cantonese, Mandarin, French, and Japanese.
                                Of these 5, I can speak English, Cantonese, and Japanese well. As for Japanese, I have
                                studied up to the JLPT N5 level.
